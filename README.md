# NV-Center Dynamics on QuTip
1. Time_Dep_H2.py simulates the Time-dependent Rabi Hamiltonian of a spin-1/2 system with qutip.mesolve().
2. NV_spin_half.py simulates Magnetic Resonance dynamics for a spin-1/2 system, with corresponding T1 and T2 decay times.
3. NV_spin_one.py simulates the NV ground state Spin Hamiltonian with zfs and changeable tuning of transitions based on resonant frequencies. T1 and T2 decay functionalities have been added separately by collaborators.
4. FloquetSQL.py simulates quantum chaotic dynamics via the Kicked Top Hamiltonian implemented with discrete Floquet propagators and generates the QFI for different evolution periods.
5. Floquet_NV.py simulates quantum chaotic dynamics for the NV-Hamiltonian of a single NV-defect center.
6. Floquet.py simulates the general time evolution of non-linear Hamiltonians with specific comparisons of the QFI with the KT-Hamiltonian.
